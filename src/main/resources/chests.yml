version: 1

# Items are stored under a number of "levels". You are free to add any different levels you want.
# Each level has a "value" and a "chance" percentage. When filling a chest, SkyWars will pick a
# level according to it's percentage chance, add a random item from that level to the chest, and
# then add the level's "item-value" to the total value in the chest. When the total value in the
# chest reaches the chest's level, SkyWars will stop adding items.
